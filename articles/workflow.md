# Workflow

For each change to my web app,
I add a card to a kanban board in [Notion](https://notion.com):

![Kanban board](/images/kanban-board.png)

The card might refer to a feature, bug, or chore.
Cards are sorted by priority in each column.

I assign myself to the card,
move it to "Doing",
and make a Git branch with
[this script](https://github.com/croaky/laptop/blob/main/bin/git-create-branch):

```bash
git create-branch my-branch
```

I edit the code.
I commit the changes to version control:

```bash
git add --all
git commit --version
```

I push to a remote branch:

```bash
git push
```

This only pushes `my-branch` to GitHub due to this setting in
`~/.gitconfig`:

```
[push]
  default = current
```

I open a pull request (PR) with
[this script](https://github.com/croaky/laptop/blob/main/bin/git-pr):

```bash
gh pr
```

This triggers webhooks that create:

1. a [CI](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) build
2. a [Slack](https://slack.com) message in my team's channel

I review the code again.
I may push follow-up changes or edit the PR description.

When CI passes,
I open the Slack thread and ask a teammate
to review:

```
@buddy PTAL
```

"PTAL" means "Please Take A Look".

When they are ready to review,
they add an ðŸ‘€ emoji to the thread
and open the PR in a browser.

They comment in-line on the code, offer feedback, and approve it.
I make and follow-up changes and commit them.
We may do these steps once, or multiple times.

My repo has these settings:

1. Require pull request reviews before merging
2. Require status checks to pass before merging
3. Require branches to be up to date before merging
4. Default commit message to pull request title and description

I press the "Squash and merge" button.

GitHub triggers a webhook to deploy the `main` branch
to my staging environment on [Render](https://render.com).

I acceptance test on staging.
When everything looks good,
I move back to the command line.

I clean up `my-branch` and check out latest `main` with
[this script](https://github.com/croaky/laptop/blob/main/bin/git-post-land):

```bash
git post-land
```

I deploy to production with a deploy script:

```bash
deploy-prod
```

I move the card on the kanban board to "Done".
