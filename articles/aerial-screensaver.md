# Aerial Screensaver

[Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial)
is a Mac screensaver of beautiful high-definition videos
by drones and satellites over land,
in outer space, and underwater.

I watch for [releases](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases)
on the GitHub project.
To upgrade to a new version,
I download the `Aerial.saver.zip` file, install,
and configure it to hide the text overlays.
