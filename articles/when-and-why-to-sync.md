# When and Why to Sync

On the [Village Global podcast](https://www.villageglobal.vc/podcast/),
Rishi Mandal, the founder of [Future](https://www.future.fit/) noted:

> I wanted to learn chess. Every Wednesday, with a highly-ranked chess player,
> we would do a FaceTime. Every Tuesday night, I would do all the week's
> assignments. That I wasn't doing them over the course of the week was actually
> okay. I was getting them done because I didn't want to look bad in front of
> someone I looked up to. This helped me realize that if you don't really care
> when someone does something, those little hooks of synchronicity distributed
> across a timeline can be the forcing function for a lot of productivity.

Rishi has applied this lesson to Future in the context of 1-on-1 digital
personal training but it reminds me of many workflows in the age of remote work.

In software engineering, we often have a "daily standup" to sync with the team
for the day. At the last series of startups I was at, these were the only
scheduled, recurring meetings we had. On Wednesdays, we had "work from home, no
meeting" days, which pushed the daily standup to a simple Slack thread started
by the first person to start working that day.

In one iteration of those startups, we had a Monday morning "all-hands" led by
Adam, our CEO. This was a great way to start the week feeling like we were all
on the same page.

Currently, I've committed myself to sending a Friday afternoon "changelog"
update to the users of the software I'm working on.

I really appreciate being held accountable to my teammates and users with these
lightweight mechanisms, especially when paired with "not really caring when
someone does something", as Rishi noted.

Remote work makes it more obvious that someone's working hours are highly
personal and flexible hours are always appreciated. "Little hooks of
synchronicity" are enough to hold ourselves accountable to others without too
many energy-sapping video conference meetings while building trust and
increasing productivity.
