# IVP

I work at [IVP](https://www.ivp.com), a venture capital firm.

IVP invests in 10-15 high-growth companies each year,
typically starting at Series B or C rounds,
right after a company has proven product/market fit.

Our team of ~75 people help companies grow and go public,
with 130+ IPOs and counting.
