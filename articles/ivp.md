# IVP

I've been working at [IVP](https://www.ivp.com)
as a software engineer since 2020.

IVP is a venture capital firm.
Since 1980, IVP has invested in ~400 companies and ~130 have gone public.
Our newest fund is [fund 18](https://www.ivp.com/content/the-road-ahead-ivp-18/),
a $1,6B vehicle.

IVP often first invests in Series B or C rounds.
Each year, we evaluate approximately ~10,000 companies,
meet with ~1,000, consider term sheets for ~100,
and invest in ~10.
