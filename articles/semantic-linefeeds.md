# Semantic Linefeeds

Writing software also involves writing
READMEs, commit messages, code comments, blog posts, and other prose.
That prose is checked into a version control system
alongside source code.

[Semantic Linefeeds](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/)
is a formatting style for that prose.
Choosing line breaks
at the end of a sentence or
at the end of a clause
can help identify, separate, and group ideas.

This style can improve the writing quality
and the reading and editing experience.

Prose formatted in short lines
can look strange,
like poetry.
Yet, reviewing such prose in a version control diff
is often a pleasure
as ideas are isolated and re-worked.
