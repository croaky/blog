# SSO Wall Of Fame

In December 2020, I added SSO to an app using [WorkOS](https://workos.com/).

It had me thinking again about the [SSO Wall of Shame](https://sso.tax/)
and whether SSO as a premium feature in SaaS pricing plans
is wrong from a security perspective
and will eventually move into base plans
in the same way that TLS on websites eventually became standard.

However, I hesitate because many products I admire
bucket SSO as a premium feature.
From their perspective, what would the financial impact
be of moving SSO out of Enterprise plans into all plans?

The IT folks I talk to have no hesitation;
they are convinced that SSO should be free.

Maybe a there should be a carrot to match the SSO Wall of Shame stick?
Could an SSO Wall of Fame help show that
SSO as a base feature can be financial successful?
