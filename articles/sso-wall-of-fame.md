# SSO Wall Of Fame

Should SSO be a feature of all SaaS pricing plans,
or only premium plans?

## Security for users

When I talk to IT folks, it's clear they have conviction that
SSO helps improve security of business users.

TLS (`https://`) on websites eventually became standard.
Perhaps SSO will move "down" into base plans in a similar way.

## Implementation for vendor

In December 2020, I added SSO to an app using [WorkOS](https://workos.com/).
It was painless and I continue to use and enjoy WorkOS ~2y later.

## Financial impact for vendor

The [SSO Wall of Shame](https://sso.tax/)
lists SaaS products where SSO as a premium feature.
Many of these are products I love and admire.

From their perspective, what would the financial impact
be of moving SSO out of Enterprise plans into all plans?

## SSO Wall of Fame

The SSO Wall of Shame tries to apply negative peer pressure,
which makes me uncomfortable.

Could an SSO Wall of Fame help show others that
SSO as a base feature can be financial successful?
