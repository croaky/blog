# SSO Wall Of Fame

I have been adding SSO to an app using [WorkOS](https://workos.com/)
(which is lovely).

It has me thinking again about the [SSO Wall of Shame](https://sso.tax/)
and whether SSO as a premium feature in SaaS pricing plans
is wrong from a security perspective
and will eventually move into base plans
in the same way that TLS on websites eventually became standard.

My instinct is "yes"
but I'm hesitating because many products I admire
operate under a principle of "SSO is a premium feature":
Airtable, Cloudflare, Figma, FullStory, GitHub, HashiCorp, Heroku, Intercom,
Netlify, Notion, Sentry, Slack, Tailscale, Trello, Twilio, Zapier.

I also hold stock in pretty much all of those public companies either directly
or via NASDAQ or S&P 500 index funds. I would love to hold stock in many of
those private companies. From their perspective, what would the financial impact
be of moving SSO out of Enterprise plans into all plans, including freemium?

My hesitation may be due partly to lack of peer pressure,
which is why the SSO Wall of Shame exists,
and partly to complexities and cost of managing SSO,
which is why WorkOS exists.

The IT folks I talk to have absolutely no hesitation;
they are passionately convinced that SSO should be free.

Maybe a there should be a carrot to match the SSO Wall of Shame stick?
Maybe there should be a SSO Wall of Fame to prove that
SSO as a base feature can succeed financially.
