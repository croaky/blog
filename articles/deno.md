# Deno

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
[v1](https://deno.land/v1) was released May 13, 2020.
Its core team includes Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.

## Why

Deno is the first runtime that has me interested in running
JavaScript/TypeScript on a server (or in serverless functions).

Deno's main innovations are:

1. Secure by default
2. No package manager

Number 2 is also security-related: the core team feels
that centralized package managers have caused more harm than good.

## Install

`deno` is shipped as a single executable. Install on macOS:

```
% brew install deno
```

## Run

Run untrusted, third-party programs safely
from the command line by referencing the source URL:

```
% deno run https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts
Download https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts
Compile https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts
Welcome to Deno ðŸ¦•
```

By default, the program does not have access to
disk, network, subprocesses, or environment variables.
Like browsers, it runs in a secure sandbox.
You can't open files or sockets.

The user has to opt in to those behaviors with flags:

```
--allow-read=/tmp
--allow-write
--allow-net=google.com
--allow-env
```

## Modules

There is no `package.json` or a centralized package management server.
Modules are imported explicitly from a server using URLs:

```ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts"
```

Deno treats modules and files as the same concept.
This is how browsers think about
[ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).
In Node, this is not the case but
in Deno, this is explicit.

Deno can be thought of as "a browser for ES modules".
[Pika CDN](https://www.pika.dev/cdn)
is one server that is particularly useful now for Deno.
Pika CDN only manages NPM packages that are bundled as ES modules
and respects Semantic Versioning:

```ts
import { Component, render } from "https://cdn.pika.dev/preact@^10.0.0"
```

There are many TypeScript types out in the world,
available on npm through `@types/` and
[DefinitelyTyped](https://definitelytyped.org/).
How can developers access those types but not have the overhead
of doing
[transpilation](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them)
and take advantage of the fact that the code has already been bundled?

If the remote server sends an HTTP header
[`X-TypeScript-Types`](https://dev.to/pika/introducing-pika-cdn-deno-p8b)
and it has the content of a URL,
Deno will use those types to type-check the package.
To handle private modules, set up a web server.

If we have these solutions (including Semantic Versioning),
why do we need a package manager?

## Standard Library

The [`https://deno.land/std/`](https://deno.land/std)
modules are the Standard Library that
the JavaScript community has wanted to exist for a long time.

The Deno team has taken most of their direction on the Standard Library
from the Go programming language's Standard Library.

## Types

Users can import URLs to TypeScript code directly.
Deno ships type definitions for the runtime, which can be seen here:

```
% deno types
```

The TypeScript compiler is compiled into Deno. The team is
[rewriting type checking in Rust](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/5432)
for better performance.
Deno was originally prototyped in Go but is now written in Rust.

Analyze its dependency tree (also works on any ES module):

```
% deno info https://bit.ly/deno-bronto
```

## CLIs

Install command line programs like this:

```
% deno install --allow-read https://deno.land/std/examples/catj.ts
Download https://deno.land/std/examples/catj.ts
...
Compile https://deno.land/std/examples/catj.ts
Successfully installed catj
/Users/croaky/.deno/bin/catj
Add /Users/croaky/.deno/bin to PATH
  export PATH="/Users/croaky/.deno/bin:$PATH"
```

`deno` is supposed to be a Swiss Army knife of tooling
without much beyond one executable installed on any machine:
yours, CI, etc.
